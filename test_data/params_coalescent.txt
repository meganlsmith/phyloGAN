# Path Parameters

IQTree path = ~/Documents/Programs/iqtree-2.2.0-beta-MacOSX/bin/iqtree2 # Path to executable for IQ-TREE.

# Input files
alignment folder = ./test_data/gene_alignments # Path to directory containing only the gene alignments.
start tree = Random # Indicate whether phyloGAN should start with a random ('Random') or neighbor joining ('NJ') tree. Random tree setting is recommended.
check point = 50 # Frequency at which checkpoint files should be stored. For example, 50 indicates that checkpoints will be stored every 50 iterations.

# Output files
results = test_ils # Path to folder for storing results.
temp = temp_ils # Path to temp folder for storing temporary files. This file will be deleted periodically.

# Models and model parameters

Nucleotide substitution model = JC # Model string for use in AliSim simulations. Any string that can be taken as input by AliSim should work.
Min coal = 0.01 # Minimum bound on coalescent parameter.
Max coal = 10 # Maximum bound on coalescent parameter.
Min scale = 0.001 # Minimum bound on scaling parameter.
Max scale = 0.05 # Maximum bound on scaling parameter. 
Width coal = None # Width of coalescent proposals. Defaults to (Max_coal + Min_coal)/2/2.
Width scale = None # Width of scale proposals. Defaults to (Max_scale + Min_scale)/2/2.

# Training steps and parameters

# all stages
Gene tree samples = 2 # Number of gene trees per mini-batch.
Length = 500 # Number of basepairs per gene tree per mini-batch.
Batch size = 2 # Number of chunks to use in each mini-batch.

# stage 1 inferring coalescent parameter and scale

Stage 1 Iterations = 2 # Number of training iterations in stage 1.
Stage 1 Proposals = 1 # number of parameter proposals to consider at each training iteration in stage 1, defaults to 15

# stage 2 inferring topology
Stage 2 Pre-training Iterations = 2 # Number of pre-training iterations in stage 2.
Stage 2 Training Iterations = 2 # Number of training iterations in stage 2.
Stage 2 Pre-training Epochs = 1 # Number of pre-training epochs in stage 2.
Stage 2 Training Epochs = 1 # Number of training epochs in stage 2, defaults to match number of pre-training epochs.
Max Trees = 1 # Maximum number of trees to consider at each training iteration in stage 2, defaults to 5.

# Simulation parameters
Simulate_pseudoobserved = False # Indicate whether phyloGAN should simulate pseudoobserved data. Used only for very specific testing scenarios.
Simulation nucleotide substitution model = JC # Indicate the model to be used by AliSim when generating pseudoobserved data.
Gene trees = 1000 # Number of gene trees to simulate for pseudoobserved data.
Num taxa = 6 # Number of taxa in pseudoobserved datasets.
Coal time = 10 # Mean of the exponential distribution parameterizing internal branch lengths in coalescent units for pseudoobserved datasets.
Scale = 0.001 # Scaling parameter for simulating sequence data in AliSim for pseudoobserved datasets.
Output pseudoobserved = ./pseudoobserved_six_coal_rep1/ # Directory and prefix for pseudoobserved data storage.
true tree = ./input_test2/baseline.tre # Path to the 'true' tree. Defaults to location in pseudoobserved output directory when pseudoobserved data are simulated. Use None if not available.
