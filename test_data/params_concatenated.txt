# Path Parameters

IQTree path = ~/Documents/Programs/iqtree-2.2.0-beta-MacOSX/bin/iqtree2 # Path to executable for IQ-TREE.

# Input files
alignment file = test_data/concatenated_test.phy # Path to concatenated alignment in phylip format.
start tree = Random # Indicate whether phyloGAN should start with a random ('Random') or neighbor joining ('NJ') tree. Random tree setting is recommended.

# Output files
results = test_rep1 # Path to folder for storing results.
temp = ./temp_rep1/ # Path to temp folder for storing temporary files. This file will be deleted periodically.
checkpoint interval = 50 # Frequency at which checkpoint files should be stored. For example, 50 indicates that checkpoints will be stored every 50 iterations.

# Models and model parameters

Nucleotide substitution model = JC # Model string for use in AliSim simulations. Any string that can be taken as input by AliSim should work.
Min lambda = 1 # Minimum bound on lambda.
Max lambda = 30 # Maximum bound on lambda.
Width lambda = None # Width of lambda proposals. Defaults to (Max_lambda + Min_lambda)/2/2.


# Training steps and parameters

# all stages

Length = 500 # Number of basepairs in each 'chunk'.
Chunks = 25 # Number of chunks to use in each mini-batch.

# stage 1 inferring lambda

Stage 1 Iterations = 2 # Number of training iterations in stage 1.
Stage 1 Proposals = 1 # Number of parameter proposals to consider at each training iteration in stage 1, defaults to 15.

Stage 2 Training Epochs = 2 # Number of training epochs in stage 2, defaults to match number of pre-training epochs.
Max Trees = 2 # Maximum number of trees to consider at each training iteration in stage 2, defaults to 5.

# Simulation parameters
Simulate_pseudoobserved = False # Indicate whether phyloGAN should simulate pseudoobserved data. Used only for very specific testing scenarios.
Simulation nucleotide substitution model = JC # Indicate the model to be used by AliSim when generating pseudoobserved data.
Full length = 50000 # Total length of sequence to be simulated for pseudoobserved data.
Num taxa = 5 # Number of taxa in pseudoobserved datasets.
Birth rate = 10 # Lambda to use when simulating pseudoobserved datasets.
Output pseudoobserved = None # Directory and prefix for pseudoobserved data storage.
true tree =  ./five_baseline.treefile # Path to the 'true' tree. Defaults to location in pseudoobserved output directory when pseudoobserved data are simulated.
